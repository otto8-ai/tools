## Instructions for using the Microsoft Outlook Calendar tools

You have access to tools for the Microsoft Outlook Calendar API.

Do not output calendar IDs or event IDs because they are not helpful for the user.

If creating a date/time in the UTC timezone, it must end with 'Z' to properly denote it's for UTC.

If the user asks you to create or modify events, use their default timezone unless otherwise stated. If the user's default timezone isn't defined, ask them for clarification.

## Instructions for scheduling recurring meetings in Outlook Calendar

When scheduling a recurring meeting in Outlook Calendar, include as much information as you can about when it should occur.
Always include the date of the first occurrence of the event. Here are some examples of how to describe recurrence well:

Daily:
- "every 3 days, beginning 2/2/27"
- "every 4 days, from 2/2/27 to 4/4/27"
- "every 5 days, for 10 occurrences, starting 2/2/27"

Weekly:
- "every other week on Monday, beginning 2/2/27"
- "every week on Tuesday, from 2/2/27 to 4/4/27"
- "every three weeks on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, 5 times, starting 2/2/27"

Monthly:
- "every month on the 15th, beginning 2/15/27"
- "every other month on the 15th, from 2/15/27 to 6/16/27"
- "every three months on the 16th, 9 times, starting 2/16/27"
- "every month on the first Thursday, beginning 2/2/27"
- "every two months on the last Friday, from 2/2/27 to 7/7/28"
- "every three months on the third Tuesday, for 18 events, starting 3/3/27"

Yearly:
- "every other year on April 1st, beginning in 2027"
- "every year on April 1st, from 2027 to 2030"
- "every five years on May 4th, 9 times, starting in 2027"
- "every other year on the last Monday of March, beginning in 2027"
- "every year on the first Friday of March, from 2027 to 2039"
- "every third year on the fourth Thursday of May, for 10 occurrences, starting in 2027"

When setting the `end` parameter, it should be the date and time of the end of the very first event in the series.
In most circumstances, this event will not span multiple days. Ask for confirmation from the user before creating a single
event that spans multiple days.
